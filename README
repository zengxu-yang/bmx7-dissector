Very basic BMX7 (v16) dissector for Wireshark.

It is updated to work with Wireshark 2.6.8.

To include the dissector you will need to place the dissector code on plugins/epan/bmx7 folder.

1. You will need to rename top level CMakeListsCustom.txt.example to CMakeListsCustom.txt and edit it.

Find:
set(CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR
#	private_plugins/foo
# or
#	plugins/epan/foo
)

and change it to:
set(CUSTOM_PLUGIN_SRC_DIR
#	private_plugins/foo
# or
	plugins/epan/bmx7
)

2. Recompile Wireshark by:
cmake <source_root>
make

3. Copy bmx7.so from <build_root>/run/plugins/2.6/epan to /usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/2.6/epan.
